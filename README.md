Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project was to create a VBA code comparing stock information from 2017 and 2018.  We were attempting to see the profitability of an array of 12 stocks Year over Year.  The raw data provided included the opening and closing values, the highest and lowest values, and the amount of shares or each respective stock.  From the data output, the purpose was to decide whether or not the stocks were a good investment.

Results:
Based on the results, it does not appear as though the majority of these stocks would be a good investment, as 10 of the 12 had diminishing returns in 2018 after showing a strong performance in 2017.  If you were to invest in any of these, the two that appear the safest would be ENPH and RUN.  See the results below.

A major advantage of reactoring code was that it made the code much eaiser to read, which is especially true when showing it to third parties who are not as familiar with the raw data.It's faster and gives you the final result a lot quicker than having to break it down in excel spreadsheets.  A disadvatage is that we are now only able to see the final results.  It does not give you the detail of the breakdown, which some people may want to use for a more thorough research of their stock decisions.
